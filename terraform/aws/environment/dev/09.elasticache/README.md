# Elasticache

ElastiCache offers two caching engines — Memcached and Redis. Valkey is the open‑source, Redis‑compatible fork maintained by the Linux Foundation that AWS now supports as a lower‑cost, drop‑in alternative. It preserves Redis protocol compatibility, command behavior, and data structures while avoiding the licensing restrictions introduced in newer Redis releases.
